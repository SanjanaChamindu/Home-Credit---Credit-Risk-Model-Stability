# Home-Credit---Credit-Risk-Model-Stability
The absence of a credit history can indicate various things, such as young age or a preference for cash. Without traditional data, individuals with little or no credit history are often denied loans. Consumer finance providers rely on data to determine loan repayment capabilities. Data science can help predict repayment abilities more accurately, potentially increasing loan accessibility for those who need it most.
Consumer finance providers use statistical and machine learning methods, known as scorecards, to predict loan risk. However, these models need regular updates and stability to remain effective. Home Credit, a consumer finance provider established in 1997, focuses on responsible lending to individuals with limited credit history. They aim to improve financial inclusion for the unbanked population.
